## odin-recipes
In this project I made a recipe website through The Odin Project foundations.

**Learning more about:** git worklflow, html, css

**Expectation:** 
- Hope to become faster with git workflow, learn something new regarding beginner HTML/CSS. 
- An experimentation with introducing SASS/SCSS to my self-learning curriculum. 

**Takeaway on completion:** Definitely became comfortable with git, learned how to use: mixins, variables and nesting with SCSS. I'm happy with how it came out!

**Time to complete:** 1 week, around 4 hrs/day

**Pain points: I need to add media queries.
