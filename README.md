# odin-recipes
In this project I made a recipe website through The Odin Project foundations.
Learning more about: git worklflow, html, css
Expectation: Hope to become faster with git workflow, learn something new regarding beginner HTML/CSS. 
An experimentation with introducing SASS/SCSS to my self-learning curriculum. 

Takeaway on completion: Definitely became comfortable with git, learned how to use: mixins, variables and nesting with SCSS. I'm happy with how it came out!
Time to complete: 1 week, around 4 hrs/day
